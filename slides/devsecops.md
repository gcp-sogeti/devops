### What Is DevSecOps?

C'est du DevOps avec de vrais bouts de sécurité dedans!

A chaque étape, on ajoute les activités de sécurité, mais aussi de sécurisation de la qualité de service.

### What Is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps refers to the integration of security practices into a DevOps software delivery model. Its foundation is a culture where development and operations are enabled through process and tooling to take part in a shared responsibility for delivering secure software.
The definition of DevSecOps Model, at a high-functioning level, is to integrate security objectives as early as possible in the lifecycle of software development. While security is “everyone’s responsibility,” DevOps teams are uniquely positioned at the intersection of development and operations, empowered to apply security in both breadth and depth.

### What Is the Difference Between DevOps and DevSecOps?

The difference between DevOps and DevSecOps is, to put it simply, the culture of shared responsibility. DevOps is a concept that has been talked about and written about for over a decade, and many definitions of DevOps have emerged. At its core, DevOps is an organizational paradigm that aligns development and operations practices as a shared responsibility.

### What Is the Difference Between DevOps and DevSecOps?

To make the difference between DevOps and DevSecOps clearer, DevSecOps extends the DevOps culture of shared responsibility to also include security practices. Activities designed to identify and ideally solve security issues are injected early in the lifecycle of application development, rather than after a product is released. This is accomplished by enabling development teams to perform many of the security tasks independently within the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### What Is the Difference Between DevOps and DevSecOps?

The approach helps minimize vulnerabilities that reach production, thereby reducing the cost associated with fixing security flaws. It creates scalability while also establishing a collaborative culture that brings security closer to DevOps objectives. DevSecOps aims to build security into every stage of the delivery process, from the requirement stage onwards, and establish a plan for security automation.

### What Is the Difference Between DevOps and DevSecOps?

The traditional slow feedback loops that bog down development are not tolerated as teams increasingly prioritize being self-sufficient — you write it, you run it.
As a result, dev teams ship insecure applications, security teams burn out, and security becomes a naysayer, negating the acceleration the business is seeking.

### DevSecOps Adoption: Integrating Security into the CI/CD Pipeline

To integrate security objectives early in the development of an application, start before the first line of code is ever written. Security can integrate and begin effective threat modeling during the initial concept of the system, application, or individual user story. Static analysis, linters, and policy engines can be run any time a developer checks in code, ensuring that any low-hanging fruit is dealt with before the changes move further upstream.

Finally, the application makes its way to production. However, the work of DevSecOps continues in earnest. Automated patching and configuration management ensure that the production environment is always running the latest and most secure versions of software dependencies. Ideally, immutable infrastructure means that the entire environment is frequently torn down and rebuilt, constantly subjected to the battery of tests along the breadth of the pipeline

### Empowering DevSecOps Culture

With security and DevOps collaborating early and often, security objectives have been tightly woven into the fabric of the infrastructure. Features and applications that are deployed to production will be the result of a comprehensive and effective collaboration between security, development, and operations. Security won’t have to go ask for extra features or auditing from development teams after the fact; they will know these were built in from day one
